# 18 NoSQ-SocialNetwork 

## User Story
As a fledgling social media startup,

I desire an API for my social network that utilizes a NoSQL database,

So that my website can proficiently manage substantial volumes of unstructured data.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given the existence of a social network API,

When I execute the command to initiate the application,

Then my server commences operation, and the Mongoose models are synchronized with the MongoDB database.

When I access the API GET endpoints in Insomnia for users and thoughts,

Then the data for each of these endpoints is presented in a well-structured JSON format.

When I validate API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia,

Then I can capably generate, modify, and erase users and thoughts within my database.

When I assess API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia,

Then I can efficiently create and remove reactions to thoughts, as well as append and withdraw friends from a user's friend list.
